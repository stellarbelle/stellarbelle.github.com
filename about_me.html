      Stella Heath is a graphic designer who was raised in Santa Cruz and just 
      recently moved the Silicon Valley.  She has had an appreciation for art 
      since she was a child, always exploring different creative outlets.  In
      high school she explored wood shop, dance, and video productions.  She 
      continued to take classes in film and radio production in college and 
      changed her sights to a BA in Sociology.  After working for three years 
      in a design center she decided to pursue a degree in graphic design where 
      she is currently in one quarter away from graduating.  She still also has
      an interest in film and like to edit videos in her spare time.
